# Let me see that Donkey Roll

This project aims to bring an instant "Donkey Roll" button, because the World needs it. At a birthday party, a wedding, or just on a walk in the park, you can
1. Flap your arms like a bird flying around
2. Point your fingers at the cold dead ground
3. Make like a dude on an Egyptian scroll
4. Don't be a Melvin, just let us see that Donkey Roll!
